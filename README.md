TRELLO CLONE APP

This project is a Trello-inspired project management app built using React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and Clerk for authentication. It allows users to create their own boards, organize tasks into lists, and manage cards with a kanban-style workflow. Users can sign up and log in securely, and the application ensures real-time updates for a seamless experience. The app works best only on dekstop and not on mobile. Also it demonstrates modern web development practices including API routes, database integration, and secure user authentication.

Current Stack: React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, Clerk, and Tailwind CSS
