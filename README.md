To Do App

This project is a Trello-inspired project management app built using React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL, and BetterAuth for authentication. Users can create boards, add lists and cards, and organize tasks with a kanban-style workflow. The app supports drag-and-drop functionality, real-time updates, and secure user authentication. The app works best only on desktop. It is user-friendly, it demonstrates modern web development practices including API routes, database integration, and clean UI design.
